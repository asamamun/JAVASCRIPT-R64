      A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has exactly two
      distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself. This means it cannot be divided
      evenly by any number other than 1 and itself. Example: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13,
      17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59
    </h1>
    <p>
      Important Notes: <br />
      2 is the only even prime number because all other even numbers are
      divisible by 2. <br />
      1 is NOT a prime number because it has only one divisor (itself). <br />
      Prime numbers are the building blocks of all numbers, as every whole
      number can be expressed as a product of primes (this is called prime
      factorization).
