    <h3>A JavaScript object is like a container that holds related data and functionality. Think of it as a real-world object, say a car: it has characteristics (like color or model) and things it can do (like drive or honk). In JavaScript, those characteristics are <mark> properties</mark>, and the things it can do are <mark> methods</mark>. For example: array object has properties like length and methods like push, pop, join,shift,unshift, slice, splice, concat etc.</h3>

        <h2>Creating a JavaScript Object</h2>
        <p>Objects are created using the keyword <b>object</b> followed by a name for the object in curly braces {}. </p>
