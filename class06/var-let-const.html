        <h1>var</h1>
        <p>var keyword is used to declare a variable. normally it is used to declare a global variable. if a variable with var keyword is declared inside a code block it is called local variable and cannot be accessed outside the block </p>
        <h1>let</h1>
        <p>let keyword is used to declare a variable. normally it is used to declare a local variable. local variable cannot be accessed outside the block. if a variable is declared with let in global scope it is same as var</p>
        <h1>const</h1>
        <p>const keyword is used to declare a variable. normally it is used to declare a constant variable whose value cannot be changed</p>
